			<h4>Ivano-Frankivsk (Ukrainian: Івано-Франківськ; formerly Stanyslaviv, Stanislau, or Stanisławów see below) is a historic city located in the western Ukraine.It is the administrative 
			centre of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (province), and is designated as its own separate raion (city of regional significance) within the oblast, city municipality. <br>
			Built in the mid 17th century as a private fortress of the Potocki family, with the partition of Poland in 1772 Ivano-Frankivsk was passed to the Habsburg Empire, after which it 
			became the property of the State authorities of the Austrian Empire. It was during that time that the fortress was transformed into one of the most prominent cities at the foothills 
			of the Carpathian Mountains. After World War I, for a short stint it served a temporary capital of the West Ukrainian People's Republic, after the fall of which Stanisławów became 
			part of the	Second Polish Republic. At the dawn of World War II, the city was "liberated" by the Soviet forces which were soon overran by the Nazi Germany. With the liberation of 
			Ukraine in 1944, Soviet regime was established in the city for the next 45 years. A few years before the fall of the Soviet Union the blue-yellow flag was raised in the city as the 
			symbol of independent Ukraine. <br>
			A city visitor may find elements of various cultures intertwined within Ivano-Frankivsk, the Polish Rathaus, the Austrian city's business center, the Soviet panel multi-stories 
			residential	apartment buildings at the city's urban-rural fringe, and others. The city is the third in population among other cities in the Carpathian Euroregion, yielding only to 
			Lviv and Košice.</h4><br>
